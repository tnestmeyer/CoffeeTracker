# Perceiving Systems Coffee Tracker

## What's this then?
A simple [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) app to track our group's caffeine consumption. Meteor is UNASHAMEDLY AWESOME and this seemed like an easy way to learn a little and hack on their leaderboard example.

## Usage

* Install Meteor - `curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh`
* Fork/Clone this project, get in there and start meteor on the port of your choice - `meteor --port 9000`
* CONSUME ALL THE CAFFEINE
* Don't forget to click '+1 to tab' when you have CONSUMED
* When you pay your tab, hit 'clear tab'

# Things to know

* Best to `meteor add insecure` to let the app update the database
* Also, add `collectionapi` from [crazytoad's repo](https://github.com/crazytoad/meteor-collectionapi) to make the REST stuff work.
